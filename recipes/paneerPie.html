    <li>4 tbsp ghee or butter</li>
    <li>2 large onions , finely sliced</li>

    <li>thumb-sized piece of ginger , finely grated</li>
    <li>½ tsp hot chilli powder</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>2 tsp fenugreek seeds</li>
    <li>1½ tbsp garam masala</li>
    <li>2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 tbsp caster sugar</li>
    <li>300g potato , peeled and cut into 2cm cubes</li>
    <li>150g spinach</li>
    <li>150g frozen peas</li>
    <li>100ml double cream</li>
    <li>2 tbsp cashew nut butter</li>
    <li>plain flour , for dusting</li>
    <li>320g sheet all-butter puff pastry</li>
    <li>2 large eggs , 1 whole, 1 yolk only, lightly beaten together (freeze the leftover egg white for another recipe)</li>
    <li>2 tsp nigella seeds</li>
    <li>pilau rice or green veg, to serve</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the oil over a medium heat in a shallow flameproof casserole dish roughly 30cm wide. Add the paneer and fry for 5 mins, turning with tongs until each side is golden. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper.</li>
    <li>Heat the ghee or butter in the same dish over a medium-low heat, then add the onions and a big pinch of salt. Fry for 15 mins, or until softened and caramelised. Stir in the garlic and ginger, cook for 1 min, then tip in the spices and fry for a further 2 mins. Scrape the spiced onions into a food processor or blender along with the tomatoes and blitz until smooth. Pour back into the pan with 1½ cans of water, then stir through the sugar and potatoes. Bring to the boil, lower to a simmer, then cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20-25 mins or until the potato is just tender.</li>
    <li>Add the spinach and peas, and cook for 5 mins. Stir in the cream and cashew butter, then return the paneer to the pan and season to taste. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. On a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry out to just bigger than your casserole dish. Cut a thin strip off each side and fix these around the edge of the casserole. Roll the pastry sheet over the top and press the edges with a fork to seal, and tuck in any overhang. Brush with the egg, sprinkle with the nigella seeds and bake for 30-35 mins or until deep golden brown. Leave to rest for 15 mins before serving with pilau rice or green veg.</li>
